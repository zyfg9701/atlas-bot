//! Adjacent-tagged notification wire wrapper with a forward-compat
//! `Custom` shape.
//!
//! Adjacent tagging (`#[serde(tag = "shape", content = "value")]`) was
//! chosen over `#[serde(untagged)]` to eliminate the spoofing risk where
//! a `Custom` payload could silently match a known PascalCase variant.
//! The collision check ([`check_custom_kind`]) runs at
//! notification-emit time, not at registration time.
//!
//! Wire shape:
//!
//! ```jsonc
//! { "shape": "known",  "value": { "type": "BashOutputChunk", ... } }
//! { "shape": "custom", "value": { "kind": "my_tool.progress", "payload": ... } }
//! ```
